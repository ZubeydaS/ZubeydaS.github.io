                <p>
                    Our goal is to prototype a Carleton College food rating app called <strong>CarlsEat</strong> that
                    allows students to easily capture images and descriptions of their food, rate dishes, and share this
                    information with fellow users. This project addresses common issues like food quality concerns,
                    easier feedback options for dining hall issues, and alternative sources for meals by students
                    posting recipes themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With CarlsEat, students will be able to better understand the dining options available to them,
                    assess the quality of food, and find alternatives that meet their dietary needs while strengthening
                    community.

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
            Our team conducted <strong>focus groups</strong> to gather user insights. The research process included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 participants per focus group.</li>
                <li>4 total interviews utilizing focus groups.</li>
                <li>A total of 8 participants contributed feedback & task completion, resulting in the measured informal UX metric averages and standard deviation statistics below.</li>

                    <strong>Participants strongly suggested the ability to comment on posts.</strong>
                    <p></br><strong>Overview: </strong> When completing the assigned tasks, participants expected to find a comment section or higher interactable social features within 
                           the prototype. A participant also added, the engagement of students commenting on subjects like, varying cultural meals that are routinely made at the dining halls, would create interesting 
                           social engagement from students who are able to rate the accuracy of the foods from their own culture.</p>
                    <p><strong>Improvements: </strong> The prototype can now create comment threads under posts. Through navigating the caret buttons, the video displays checking 
                    a potential thread of users from a recipe review through the feed page and into new elements for the high-fidelity stage. The comment section allows for a social user interface, and 
                    allowed for the creation of a more interactive feed page.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            There could be comments under there.”
                        </blockquote>

                    <strong>Participants found difficulties with clicking certain button elements which affected intuitiveness of the prototypes deisgn .</strong>
                    <p></br><strong>Overview: </strong>The partcipants found that the caret icon used to collapse and expand various posts in the protype was quite small. As well as finding some placements such as the 
                        'like' element was hard to intuitively spot. Resulting in higher errors for the Informal UX metrics. The perception that the button was not assessable at the mid-fidelity stage because of its small size, 
                        caused question for which features were available for participants to engage with.</p>
                    <p><strong>Improvements: </strong>To mitigate these concerns, the caret button on the pages have been changed to be solid, have shadow drop-down effects, and 
                    have wider area to click. Or users can choose other areas close to the caret button to activate it's purpose (like the image icon). For example, the photo icon shown in the feed is seen to be used to explore the design and create 
                a post. Additionally, the heart icon has increased in size and can now be clicked to show a liked post. Icons and elements were experiemntally moved to create better transparency.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            If the button could be expanded a little bit to include a larger area... because that just feels more intuitive.”
                        </blockquote>  
                        <blockquote>
                            I think the button was a little bit finicky, especially if you're doing it on your phone really quickly. If you're trying to click on it, you have to click in one specific place."

                    <strong>Participants recommended new engaging feautures for student interests.</strong>
                    <p></br><strong>Overview: </strong>Participants brought up interesting perspectives regarding what users would potentially seek when using a food rating app. One user suggested a themed interface, 
                        similar to how the dining halls offer unique meals depending on the holiday or season. There was also the suggestion to have a rating option for the posts themselves, so not only does 
                        the meal receive a rating from the poster, but others can also rate the public post, which almost acts as a precautionary moderating system. Lastly, a participant noted that students on 
                        the platform would likely want to communicate with fellow students, especially within POC spaces.</p>
                        <p><strong>Improvements: </strong>This feedback opened the door to further developing the "add friends" feature or private post option. This feedback led to the creation of a text or chat option 
                            for the prototype. People would be able to create their own group chats and add friends they'd like. Additionally, as seen in the video, rating systems via upvotes and downvotes have been 
                            implemented. There is also an example of themed app changes, such as autumn colors during Halloween, as well as changed voting buttons and styling.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Or have monthly themes like on Reddit... applying to college on Ivy day. The upvote was Harvard, and then the down vote was the Yale”
                        </blockquote>        
                        <blockquote>
                            Having a rating system... like or upvotes and downvotes, but then it can get heated."
                        </blockquote>  
                        <blockquote>
                            There's [regarding meals] like a thing where it's, 'what did POC say?'... It would be funny. Like, you know, 'does it get the black vote?'""

                    <p></br><strong>Overview: </strong>A participant noticed that the forms for review and the page can be organized to deliberately separate mandatory and optional 
                        items on their respective pages. The participant mentioned that users can become stuck on forms due to the confusion of what elements are needed 
                        to complete the post, which may cause user frustration.</p>
                    <p><strong>Improvements: </strong>This advice is great for creating a platform that is easy for users to explore. Due to this concern, and the fear that users 
                        would dismiss more important items, the order of the post elements has been changed. Basic information remains at the top, which is the same, but now, 
                        the food tags and ingredient list inputs have been prioritized over all other inputs due to the safety issues that ignoring these tags may cause.
                        The lack of those inputs filled would diminish the purpose of CarlsEat. Thoughtful rating are encouraged and disclaimer of ingrediants are encouraged.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            sometimes we’re forced to go through forms where it makes you have mandatory ones mixing with optional."
                        </blockquote>  
                        <blockquote>
                            I think it's important to have certain stuff be mandatory… and then they can add the photo and like the optional stuff."

    <!-- Future Steps w/ Justifications-->
    <section id="future_steps">
        <h2>Future Steps from High-Fidelity Prototype & Justifications</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Additional workflows :</strong> <span class="arrow">&xrarr;</span> For my focus group's 2nd metric, there was a high rate of clickable errors, which was mitigated by my team's average scores for their error metric. A future step 
            would be to ensure that elements users would assume are usable features of the prototype are always interactable in some way unless the object is designed to be static. I consider this a future step because, although
            some workflows have been added to the high-fidelity prototype, there could still be more potential workflows added with additional user testing. Additionally, given the limited timeframe to make the prototype elements 
            fully interactable within the course's timeframe, a specific future step is to add additional workflows to elements not addressed in previous user testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Consistent layout: </strong> <span class="arrow">&xrarr;</span> Styling the Figma prototype in a consistent format has been difficult, as this is the first time I have used Figma. A future endeavor to pursue would be to check if 
            my button sizing, color palette, and general design choices appear consistent and intuitive in future rounds of user testing. Feedback I received highlighted that my design was well-received, but the design could still 
            be improved in terms of consistency throughout the pages, particularly in relation to the feedback on workflows. The design layout and what users see as interactable objects directly correlate with each other. Many of 
            the user suggestions were about buttons or not understanding which parts were interactable, so by fixing the styling, user feedback would be satisfied. A complete user interface design with cohesion would help future viewers
            of the prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Drawbacks of Feedback: </strong><span class="arrow">&xrarr;</span> However, with the addition of several new features, I found it challenging to maintain an aesthetically pleasing design that didn’t feel overcrowded. At times, it felt 
            like there were too many features in one space, making the interface feel a bit cluttered. Despite following the feedback and requirements, a more minimalist approach to design might help improve the overall user experience. 
            Simplifying the interface while retaining all necessary features could make it easier for users to navigate and engage with the app design without feeling overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Comment Options: </strong><span class="arrow">&xrarr;</span> If our team hypothetically restarted the Requirements Generation, I believe it would have been best to add a requirement indicating that some sort of comment section is 
            mandatory, since my user feedback primarily focused on not being able to comment on users' posts. Additionally, my teammates naturally added a comment section in their prototypes, so adding this requirement would not be 
            labor-intensive, but rather would add transparency to a feature I initially overlooked.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Themed Months or Holiday Features: </strong><span class="arrow">&xrarr;</span> Users showed interest in the concept of themed months or holiday features (e.g., special design changes for Halloween or Valentine's Day). A future step would be to implement a toggle 
            feature that allows users to switch between different themes for different months or holidays, enhancing the fun and personalized experience of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Bon App Menu: </strong><span class="arrow">&xrarr;</span> One suggestion was the integration of the design with existing dining services, such as Carleton’s menu options. The Menu page has a menu button for each dining hall, but is not interactable due to Bon App's 
            changing daily menus. A future step would be to explore how adding Bon App's menu could be achieved through my design. This would provide more relevant and real-time information to users.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Accessibility Features: </strong><span class="arrow">&xrarr;</span> One area that could be improved is the accessibility of the prototype. A participant mentioned that they found the design easy to read which surprised them to due their dyslexia. Which leads to other 
            improvements in design that could benefit different users with varying needs like if someone could use this design with features like screen reader compatibility, high-contrast modes, or keyboard navigation. A future step would be to ensure the prototype complies 
            with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to improve accessibility for all users, particularly those with disabilities. This would positively impact the range of users needed to test the design.

            <h2>Team UX Research Process for Requirements Elicitation Protocols</h2>
            <p>
            Our team conducted a combination of <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong> and <strong>focus groups</strong> to gather user insights. The research process included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 one-on-one semi-structured interviews.</li>
                <li>3 participatory design interviews utilizing focus groups.</li>
                <li>A total of 8 participants contributed feedback, resulting in 5 interviews conducted by team members overall.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            This interview style allowed for direct questions and answers, leading to actionable user insights. Some notable user feedback included:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
            “I think it would be cool to see what other people are making, and I might get ideas from that.”
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            “It would be great for people to take photos of the meals. Like, 'Hey guys, this is what it looks like.' You know what I mean?"
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            “I have allergies, and Carleton is not so great about cross-contamination.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            Key themes that emerged from the research included concerns about allergens, convenience, pricing, meal quality, and social engagement.

        <h2>Team Analysis Process for Requirements Elicitation Protocols</h2>
        <p>
        Our team utilized <strong>axial coding</strong> and <strong>affinity diagramming</strong> 
        to analyze our interview transcripts and build consensus for our requirement statements. 
        The process involved six key steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Initial Axial Coding</li>
            <li>Affinity Diagramming</li>
            <li>Creating a Codebook</li>
            <li>Axial Coding with the Codebook</li>
            <li>Consensus Building</li>
            <li>Requirements Generation</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        Our affinity diagram categorizes the axial coding outcomes from the transcripts. We identified 
        <em>phenomena</em>, <em>conditions</em>, <em>actions</em>, and <em>consequences</em> using blue 
        sticky notes. These were connected to yellow sticky notes, which summarized team-generated short 
        descriptors. Each yellow sticky note mapped to a section, color-coded based on the type of concept 
        (phenomena, conditions, actions, or consequences), corresponding to axial codes from each team member.</p>
        <p>
        This process helped us develop a comprehensive codebook that refined our understanding of the data until we 
        reached a consensus on our interviews. Ultimately, we generated nine requirement statements.
        </p>

    <!-- User Needs & Concerns Section: Requirements Elicitation-->
    <section id="user_needs-1">
        <h2>How the Prototype Addresses User Needs for Figma Prototype 1</h2>
        <p>
            Based on our user research and the elicitation process, which included focus groups and interviews with
            Carleton students, this prototype offers an intuitive platform for sharing dining experiences. Students will
            be able to rate food, capture images, and identify alternatives for specific dietary needs, particularly for
            those with food allergies or dietary restrictions. This addresses the need for an easy to navigate app that
            combines multiple functions of the dining hall experience into one app, while simultaneously allowing users
            to provide their input and feedback to create a better dining hall experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Making the app accessible to non-Carleton users was a topic of discussion during one focus group interview. 
            This was a thoughtful suggestion to use in the planning so that parents or visitors can see dining hall options
            and reviews in an efficient manner. Another area of concern was the general quality of the dining hall food and 
            issue of cross contamination with allergens. This concern can be properly addressed with CarlsEat due to the 
            social element of the app. Users can leave reviews of foods they enjoyed, but also of those that might pose risk.
            This social element could cause change if enough people leave reviews of the same issue, rather than the feedback
            option provided currently which creates a more confrontational environment. With this interface, feedback remains
            constructive and efficient.

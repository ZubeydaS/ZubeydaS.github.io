                <p>
                    Our goal is to prototype a Carleton College food rating app called <strong>CarlsEat</strong> that
                    allows students to easily capture images and descriptions of their food, rate dishes, and share this
                    information with fellow users. This project addresses common issues like food quality concerns,
                    easier feedback options for dining hall issues, and alternative sources for meals by students
                    posting recipes themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With CarlsEat, students will be able to better understand the dining options available to them,
                    assess the quality of food, and find alternatives that meet their dietary needs while strengthening
                    community.

    <!-- User Needs & Concerns Section: Requirements Elicitation-->
    <section>
        <h2>How the Prototype Addresses User Needs</h2>
        <p>
            Based on our user research and the elicitation process, which included focus groups and interviews with
            Carleton students, this prototype offers an intuitive platform for sharing dining experiences. Students will
            be able to rate food, capture images, and identify alternatives for specific dietary needs, particularly for
            those with food allergies or dietary restrictions. This addresses the need for an easy to navigate app that
            combines multiple functions of the dining hall experience into one app, while simultaneously allowing users
            to provide their input and feedback to create a better dining hall experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Making the app accessible to non-Carleton users was a topic of discussion during one focus group interview. 
            This was a thoughtful suggestion to use in the planning so that parents or visitors can see dining hall options
            and reviews in an efficient manner. Another area of concern was the general quality of the dining hall food and 
            issue of cross contamination with allergens. This concern can be properly addressed with CarlsEat due to the 
            social element of the app. Users can leave reviews of foods they enjoyed, but also of those that might pose risk.
            This social element could cause change if enough people leave reviews of the same issue, rather than the feedback
            option provided currently which creates a more confrontational environment. With this interface, feedback remains
            constructive and efficient.
